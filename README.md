#📌 Key Features

- ✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Removed nulls, normalized formats, and handled categorical features.
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth statistics on state-wise performance, population categories, and scheme saturation levels.
- 📈 **Correlation Analysis**: Relationship between road completion, population categories (SC/ST), and timeline delays.
- 🌍 **State/District Comparisons**: Ranking and analysis based on road completion rate and inclusion.
- 📌 **Visual Analytics**: Beautiful and intuitive visualizations using Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## 🔍 Project Insights

- States like **Uttarakhand**, **Rajasthan**, and **Himachal Pradesh** show commendable progress in hilly regions.
- High delays in northeastern states prompted by terrain complexity and logistics.
- Strong correlation between **ST population %** and **road requirement urgency**.
- Temporal trends reveal peaks during financial year closures.

## 🔮 Scope for Future Enhancements

1. Time-Series Forecasting using ARIMA/Prophet models.
2. Geo-spatial visualization via GIS libraries.
3. Cluster analysis of district-wise performance (K-Means, DBSCAN)
4. Integrating datasets on literacy, poverty, and infrastructure.
5. Live dashboards with Streamlit/Dash.
6. Real-time API integration for dynamic updates.
7. Extending the framework to include education and healthcare indices.
8. Predictive modeling for policy decision support.
9. Mobile and web-based administrator interface for regional monitoring.
